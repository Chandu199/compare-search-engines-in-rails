Web applications can accumulate a lot of data—a good search feature is crucial for users to navigate this data and find the information they need. Search is hard, though! That's why search engines such as Elasticsearch and Apache Solr are so popular.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor José Mota will show you how to incorporate search into your web application. You'll create an application for searching a database of Envato Tuts+ courses with features such as date range filtering, full-text search and search result pagination. Follow along and you'll see how to implement these features with Elasticsearch or with Sunspot (a Ruby interface to Apache Solr).
